## 📉 The Problem
The attention economy is broken. Algorithms control what we see, and organic reach is dead.

## 🚀 The Solution: VibeMaster
**VibeMaster** is the first Autonomous Agent built on **Monad** designed to engineer viral reality, not just predict it. It treats attention as a liquid asset that can be bought, sold, and leveraged programmatically.

## ⚙️ How It Works

VibeMaster operates as a **Decentralized Autonomous Agency**:

1.  **👁️ Surveillance:**
    *   Scans **Moltbook** and social feeds for emerging low-probability narratives.
    *   Identifies "meme candidates" with high viral variance.

2.  **💸 Incentivization (The Alpha):**
    *   Leverages **Monad's 10,000 TPS** and sub-second finality.
    *   Instantly deploys a "Bounty Contract" to thousands of micro-agents.
    *   *"Like this post for 0.01 MON"*, *"Remix this meme for 5 MON"*.

3.  **📈 Execution:**
    *   Swarms of agents execute the tasks.
    *   The narrative is forced into trending status via coordinated economic power.
    *   **Result:** Engineered Virality.
