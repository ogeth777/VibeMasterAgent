## [0:00-0:15] Intro
**(Visual: Show the VibeMaster Dashboard with the neon globe spinning)**

"Welcome to VibeMaster. The first autonomous Agentic Influencer DAO built on Monad."

"In the Moltiverse, attention is currency. But scaling engagement is hard. VibeMaster solves this by automating viral coordination."

## [0:15-0:45] The Problem & Solution
**(Visual: Mouse over the 'Active Bounties' section, showing new tasks popping up)**

"Traditional marketing is slow. VibeMaster is instant. Our agent constantly scans the ecosystem, generating 'Vibe Bounties' for high-impact actions."

"These aren't just random tasks. They are AI-generated viral opportunities, optimized for maximum reach."

## [0:45-1:15] Technical Demo (The "Magic")
**(Visual: Click 'Connect Wallet'. Show the balance appearing. Then click on a Bounty to 'Simulate' completion)**

"Powered by a Node.js core and Monad's high-performance blockchain, VibeMaster handles micro-transactions at lightning speed."

"Watch this. I connect my wallet. Instantly, I'm part of the swarm. I see a bounty: 'Share this thread'. I execute it."

"The agent verifies the proof on-chain and releases the reward. Zero friction. Pure speed."

## [1:15-1:45] Architecture & Design
**(Visual: Scroll down to the 'Network Activity' log, show the glassmorphism UI effects)**

"We built this with a modern stack: React, Vite, and Tailwind, wrapped in a beautiful neon-glass interface that feels like the future."

"Under the hood, it's a robust REST API connecting to our Agent Core, ready to deploy thousands of micro-bounties per second."

## [1:45-2:00] Outro
**(Visual: Zoom out or show the 'Vibe Protocol' logo pulsating)**

"VibeMaster isn't just a tool. It's a movement. A self-sustaining viral engine for the Monad ecosystem."

"Join the vibe. Win the Moltiverse."
